============

I just (april 18, 2013) found a piece of software I wrote in 2006, while I was in highschool, and thought it'd be fun to have it stored in here. I haven't tested the code for 7 years and I was very unexperienced at the time I wrote it. Most of the comments and documentation are written in portuguese.

Requirements (translated from the 4.0 version install.txt file):
	- A PHP-capable webserver (tested in Apache, Abyss, Xitami and IIS)
	- PHP 4.1.1
	- 32 MB RAM
	- 100KB of free space (needed space scales with the chatlog sizes)
