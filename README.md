I just (april 18, 2013) found a piece of software I wrote in 2006 and thought it'd be fun to have it stored in here.

At the time I had just joined the local public technical school and my rig was a Pentium MMX 233MHZ with 32MB RAM and a 2GB HDD running Windows 98. Yes, I had a MMX in 2006 and yes people did laugh at me but my young, shy, brave and quite emotional me made himself respected by coding the shit out of this old machine while everyone else had their over powered Pentium 4s.

Requirements (translated from the 4.0 version install.txt file):

  * A PHP-capable webserver (tested in Apache, Abyss, Xitami and IIS)
  * PHP 4.1.1
  * 32 MB RAM
  * 100KB of free space (needed space scales with the chatlog sizes)
